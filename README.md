Creating a Word Cloud in Python using a Dictionary from a text file

For input a Text file was uploaded using Browse button from local server. For my input, I chose a text version of Commencement Address by Steve Jobs at Stanford.

This Project was a part of a course by Coursera titled 'Crash Course on Python' by Google!
